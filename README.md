# Snowflake Data Pipeline with AWS Integration

## Overview

This project involves building a robust data pipeline using Snowflake and integrating it with various AWS services to handle big data workloads. The pipeline automates data ingestion, processes large datasets, and generates comprehensive reports. The goal is to streamline data handling and reporting processes, providing valuable insights through efficient data management.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated data ingestion from various sources into Snowflake.
- **Data Processing**: Handling and processing large-scale datasets using Snowflake’s data warehouse capabilities.
- **AWS Integration**: Utilized AWS services such as S3 and EC2 for storage and compute resources.
- **Reporting**: Generated detailed reports based on processed data to provide actionable insights.

## Architecture

- **Snowflake**: Cloud data platform for storing and processing data.
- **AWS S3**: Storage service for data files.
- **AWS EC2**: Compute service for executing data processing tasks.
- **Snowflake Pipeline**: Configured to automate data ingestion and transformation.

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Snowflake Account
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Snowflake

### Steps

1. **Setup AWS S3 Bucket:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket to store data files.

2. **Setup AWS EC2 Instance:**
   - Launch an EC2 instance with appropriate configuration.
   - Install necessary software for data processing.

3. **Configure Snowflake:**
   - Create a Snowflake account if not already available.
   - Set up your Snowflake environment, including database, schema, and tables.

4. **Create Snowflake Pipe:**
   - Define a Snowflake pipe to automate data ingestion from S3.
   - Use Snowflake's COPY command to load data from S3 into Snowflake.

5. **Data Transformation:**
   - Write SQL scripts or use Snowflake's data transformation features to process the data as needed.

6. **Generate Reports:**
   - Create SQL queries or use Snowflake’s reporting tools to generate comprehensive reports based on the processed data.

7. **Automation:**
   - Set up scheduling or event-driven automation for the data pipeline using AWS services or Snowflake tasks.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data Files:**
   - Place data files into the S3 bucket created in the setup.

2. **Run Data Pipeline:**
   - Trigger the data pipeline to start the ingestion and processing process.

3. **View Reports:**
   - Access generated reports in Snowflake or download them as needed.
